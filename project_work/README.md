# Twitter Analysis from Sanders Analytics

The twitter sentiment corpus created by Sanders Analytics (failed company), consists of 5513 hand-classified tweets (however, 400 tweets missing due to the scripts created by the company). 

Each tweet was classified with respect to one of four different topics. And a twitter account password hash file is included as well.


The dataset is available in this folder as ```tweet_sentiment.csv```, the complete version can be found [here](https://github.com/zfz/twitter_corpus)


Your goal for this project will consist of:

* Clean the dataset from broken data;
* Build and train at least two classifiers using scklearn and using the TF-IDF vectorizer with the tokenizer provided by the NLTK library;
* Provide quantative metrics for the evaluation of your model;
* Provide a critique qualitative analysis of both correct and wrong preditions;
